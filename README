--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT WAS TO FIND THE SHORTEST PATH TO A REQUESTED DESTINATION
SIMILAR TO GOOGLE MAPS OR A CAR'S GPS DEVICE. 
THIS PATH IS THEN DISPLAYED ON A CUSTOM WIRED ARDUINO WITH A SCREEN AND JOYSTICK.

ASSIGNMENT 2 PART 2 README

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Accessories:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adafruit ILI9341 screen
Joystick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Screen Wiring:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Connect the following pins (as per the wiring instructions on eClass):
Board Pin <---> Arduino Pin
===========================
GND             GND
Vin             5V
3Vo             NOT CONNECTED
CLK             52
MISO            50
MOSI            51
CS              10
D/C             9
RST             NOT CONNECTED
Lite            NOT CONNECTED
Y+              A2 (analog pin)
X+              4  (digital pin)
Y-              5  (digital pin)
X-              A3 (analog pin)
IM0 - IM3       NOT CONNECTED (they expect a 3.3v signal, DON'T CONNECT!)
CCS             6
CD              NOT CONNECTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Joystick wiring:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Joystick GND -> Arduino GND
Joystick +5V -> Arduino +5V
Joystick VRx -> Arduino A1 (analog)
Joystick VRy -> Arduino A0 (analog)
Joystick SW -> Arduino 2 (digital)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to Use:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plug in the Arduino through the USB port, navigate to the project directory and use the "make upload" command in the
terminal. Use the joystick to move the cursor around the screen. Moving the cursor to one of the edges of the screen shifts the
image in that direction, provided there is enough space. The rating selector shows the minimum number of stars that you want your restaurants to be.
Stars are listed from bottom to top, so tap a higher location to select a higher rating. Tap a lower star to lower the rating.

Pressing the joystick's digital button will create a list of the 30 closest restaurants. Scroll to the bottom of a page and press down to see another page.
You can return to the previous page by pressing up at the top of the list. After using the joystick to highlight one of the options, pressing the joystick button will take you back
to the map and the cursor will be positioned overtop of the selected restaurant on the map.
